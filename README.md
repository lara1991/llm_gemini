This is a starter project to explore google gemini-pro and google gemini-pro-vision with langchain framework. Additionally I have used Midas model to generate depth map image for a given particular image.


Steps to run the program:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 project_v1/project_code.py

Note that the images used in this repo are not mine and found from the internet and credit to the original authors.
